      <h1>Dino Dice</h1>
      <p>
        Dino Dice was a mobile phone app I created while working for a company named Nerdy Dragon. I learned how to use
      Construct 3, JSON storage structures, and how to communicate with clients.

          Dino Dice is the first project I worked on during my internship at Nerdy Dragon. The goal of the project was
          to create a virtual version of some math exercises DMTI
          had created. I created this project in Construct 3 and was the sole programmer and game designer for this
          project. I did not create the graphics for this game but I
          did create the sounds that play when you get and answer right or wrong. It is now available on the Apple Store
          and Google Play.

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        To make this game I created three different scripted scenes within Construct 3: Menu, game and results.
        The main menu houses all the level selects and the audio options for the students. When the game starts it heads
        to that menu and checks to see if their is previous level data.
        If there isn't it creates a new storing system and if there is it loads the data and unlocks levels accordingly.
        Players can then cycle through game modes and levels before moving to the game screen. When the game scene loads
        it checks to see what level type the player selected and then
        runs the proper script for the level. Each of the four game modes has a separate script that goes through each
        part of the levels. Finally the results screen pulls
        the data from the level that was completed and shows the player their score. A player is then given the option
        to go to the next level or back to the home screen.
      </p>
    <br />
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        The first challenge I had with this game was figuring out how to create the actual level cycle. Before
        completing this project I had never used Construct 3 before. To do this I create a variable that tracks the part of the question
        and separated the level into different parts. The game tracks which part the player is on and then activates the code for that part. 
        It's similar to a function but instead it's nested block code. The second challenge with this game was learning how to create 
        scoring system. The actual idea was easy but I had to learn how to use JSON structures to store
        information and then pull that information out to use. This took a long process of trial and error of finding out how to
        setup the initial storage and rewrite it. The menu system does the initial pull of information into a temporary active
        storage for the game to use. Whenever a player gets a new score the game checks to see if it is greater than the previous
        score on a level and then it rewrites that key's information in the JSON storage.
