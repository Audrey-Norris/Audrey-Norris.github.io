      <h1>Arcanic</h1>
      <p>
        Arcanic was a game that I helped develop in Unity and made all the 3D assets for. Through it I learned game design, art flow piplines, and project management.

            Arcanic was the second game that my partner and I competed with in the SkillsUSA State and National competitions. In this game you play as Wrench an Inxo protector of ancient magical relics and while on patrol one day a villain tries to steal them! Wrench tries to fight the villain to get them back but the artifacts react and teleport them both to a previously unknown island. It's now up to Wrench to get the relics back and stop the villain before it's to late.
            In this game I was the primary designer and lead a team of designers who assisted me with different aspects of the UI and character design. My partner and I worked on the actual game mechanics and concept together.
            Arcanic won 1st place at the state level and then went on to get 1st place at the national level for our competition.

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        This game had a complicated character design process and I spent a lot of time working with each character individually. This game included 4 humanoid character models as well as a couple enemy designs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Wrench:</b>
        The main protagonist got the most love when it came to character design. He was inspired by an old sketch I had made based off of the main chracter from Ori and the Will of the Wisps. While I continued to improve the design I took inspiration from axolotls and wanted the character to look simple and cute. Wrench was modeled in Maya and textured in Adobe Substance Painter 3D. His animations were done through Adobe Mixamo but I had to clean up the rigging in Maya.
        <br/>
        <b>The Masked Man:</b>
        The Masked Man was a simpler character design as I took the base of Wrench and then built off of that. For his design I wanted him to be a character that was off-putting at first but ended up being the most helpful npc in the game. He's hunched over and covers his face with a mask and always wobbles around for his idle animation. The Masked man was made in Maya and textured in Adobe Substance Painter 3D though all his animations were done in Mixamo.
        <br/>
        <b>Engot:</b>
        Engot is a protagonist from a game we made in our Sophomore year that we wanted to pay homage too. He is a vendor in the game that the player has to find to be able to leave the tutorial area. His design is based off the warforged in dungeons and dragons and has the ability to shoot projectiles from his fingers i.e. Finger Guns. He was remodeled for this game in Maya and textured in Adobe Substance Painter 3D though all his animations were done in Mixamo.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        This game was a challenge because I had a lot of characters and items to create for the game in a style I hadn't attempted before. In addition to that I was the primary person in charge of our two designers, one sound artist and our video producer on top of everything else. I had to create a system of accountability though timesheets with our team and make sure to check in with them often enough to make sure things were getting done. I learned a lot about managing a team through this and I think it was a very helpful experience. The other challenge for this project was just learning Substance Painter 3D since I had never used it before. I did a couple tutorials and then just started experimenting with the characters until I found what worked for this project. </p>
