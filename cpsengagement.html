                As the College/Postsecondary National Officer Team we wanted to be able to better engage our members and find ways to increase the amount of National Officer Candidates as our team 
                had not increased to over two in the past four years. We knew that there were many ways we could target this but we needed to find our most important thing to work on.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a commitee we wrote down and discussed all the things we felt we could target and that might be important to our members. Better communication between states, 
                better pathways to interact with members and increase National Officer candidates. Considering we only had about four months to implement our strategies we decided to focus on candidates 
                as it felt like the one most achieveable at the time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As the commitee leader I managed our communications, planned our meetings, and structured our ideas. While working on this committee we focused on two things, creating content we could use to 
                promote national office and communicate some of the problems to the staff that they might be able to help fix. I focused on finalizing and cleaning up our ideas so they could be used to present 
                to our staff to gain approval. I created a SMART goal format for our plan, creating identifiable steps for our project with my teammate. Through this I then created a plan of presentation for 
                speaking with the staff and requested a time to meet with our trainer. Through our work we were able to highlight some problems with the election process and start generating ideas on how to 
                improve engagement.

            </p>
            <p>
                Overall this was a very good learning experience for me, from begining to end I learned how to present a proposal to an audience, manage scope, and keep on timeline. I struggled at times to keep 
                on timeline as we were very busy with other tasks but I think this helped me learn how to only take on achieveable segments and work towards them which ultimately made us successful in our planning.
