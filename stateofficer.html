        <h4>Leadership and Meeting Management</h4>

            <p>
                Throughout our term a big thing my team wanted to do was find better ways to engagement with the members of our organization. Many times as National Officers it can be hard to find 
                ways to reach out to your members and engage them in meaningful ways. One thing we wanted to better target this year was our state officers. As leaders our leadership can sometimes be 
                most effective by targeting a small group of people who can go forward take those lessons to another group of people instead of trying to target everyone at once. We decided we would 
                try to find a way to best serve that group of members.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a commitee we identified the challenges, wants, and strengths of our different ideas. We recognized that because we lived all over the country and can't reach every state 
                officer in person we would have to tailor our strategies to virtual environments. We looked at many forms of engagement as well, whether it informational, fun or more passive as well.
                If we should do meetings with them, make social media challenges, or create a mailing list we looked at all of our options. Our biggest challenge was meshing to the virtual environment
                 and having too many ideas, we noticed that if we tried to implement to many ideas it would make things very hard for acomplishing all of them and decided to settle on one idea and using
                  it to gather information. We also found that many of our ideas would be hard to track and engage through virtual tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our solution was to create monthly officer engagement meetings and focus on the fun and informative side within that instead of creating many solutions. Once this was done we began to want 
                to create a structure for the event. We would start our events with updates, talking about what our team has done during the time in between events and talk about our future plans as a team 
                going forward. Once we finished answering questions we would go into a game or fun event, first time playing kahoot and gartic phone while having some fun talking with our members. For our first 
                meeting I was designated as the host and setup the kahoot as well as the plans for how we would introduce things. I made notes on our updates and wrote a greetings as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall this meeting went very well and gave me some insight into how to improve my skills as a presenter and game creator. Trying to find ways to engage people virtually is a challenge
                and I want to find more ways to better do that.
